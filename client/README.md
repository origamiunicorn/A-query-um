# A-Query-Um
> A web app for locating basic information about aquarium fresh and saltwater fish.

# Functionality
When initially running the application the user will be introduced to the homepage that gives the user the ability to use the search bar and search for aquarium fish and will be directed to a new page displaying all fish with the name searched and the user can click on the fish of their choice to be directed to a new page displaying an image and some basic information relating to the fish. The user can also scroll down to view some links to articles for Aquarium Fish Care Guides that were web-scraped from [theaquariumguide.com](https://www.theaquariumguide.com/aquarium-fish-care-guides) The user also has the ability to sign-up and create an account or sign-in to an existing account. Once the user creates an account or logs-in to an existing, they now have the ability to save fish that they have searched and add them to their own personal aquarium!
